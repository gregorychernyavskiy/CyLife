## Features

### Real-Time Communication
- **Chat WebSocket**: Facilitates real-time communication within clubs. Only users who are members of a specific club can view and participate in its chat.
- **Notification WebSocket**: Notifies users when a student joins a specific club and displays the chat history for that club.

### Event Management
- Clubs can create and manage events.
- Events automatically disappear after their scheduled time ends.

### User Management
- Users are identified by their email, which acts as a unique identifier.
- Each user has:
  - A database-generated user ID.
  - An email and password for authentication.
  - A user type (either `STUDENT` or `STAFF`).

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Built with **Spring Boot**.
- Uses **MySQL** for database management.
- Key functionalities include WebSocket management for chats and notifications, and event lifecycle management.

### Frontend
- Web-based user interface for seamless interaction.
- Focused on intuitive navigation and usability.

### Database Design
- **User Table**: Stores user details including email, password, and type.
- **Clubs Table**: Manages club information.
- **Events Table**: Connected to Clubs, allowing them to create and manage events.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Install Java 17.
2. Install Apache Maven.
3. Set up a MySQL database and ensure the connection configuration matches the project requirements.

### Steps
As the **Backend Lead** for CyLife, here is how to set up and run the backend:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gregorychernyavskiy/CyLife.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd CyLife/Backend
   ```
3. Ensure you are in the folder containing the `mvn` executable before building the project. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
   This will create the `.jar` file in the `target` folder.
4. Securely copy the `.jar` file to the server using `scp`:
   ```bash
   scp target/Backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar your_username@coms-3090-065.class.las.iastate.edu:~
   ```
5. Access the server via SSH to launch the application:
   ```bash
   ssh your_username@coms-3090-065.class.las.iastate.edu
   ```
   Navigate to the directory where the `.jar` file was copied, and run the application:
   ```bash
   java -jar Backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
6. To test the backend without the frontend, you can use **Postman** to make API calls and verify functionality.

## POM.xml Configuration
The `pom.xml` file is configured to use Java 17 and includes dependencies for:
- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for backend development.
- **MySQL Connector**: For database integration.
- **Spring WebSocket**: For real-time communication.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **OpenAPI (SpringDoc)**: To generate API documentation.
- **JUnit and Rest-Assured**: For testing.
- **Lombok**: To simplify Java boilerplate code.

The `spring-boot-maven-plugin` is included for packaging the application as a `.jar` file, ensuring ease of deployment and compatibility with servers.

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Branching**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```
2. **Code Quality**: Follow best practices and write unit tests for new features.
3. **Pull Requests**: Ensure pull requests are reviewed and approved before merging.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more granular role-based access controls.
- Integrate a mobile-friendly interface.
- Support advanced analytics for clubs and events.
